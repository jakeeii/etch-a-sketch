# etch-a-sketch
A simple Etch-a-Sketch created with Javascript. The goal of this project was to
expand my knowledge with Javascript, more specifically using Javascript to
manipulate the DOM. The Etch-a-Sketch is dynamic and can be scaled up to a 
100x100 grid. I have also added a reset button to allow the user to reset the
grid and change the size. 

Later, I would like to revisit this project to add a few extra features including
different colors (rainbow, grayscale, etc.) and an eraser as well as update the
GUI.
